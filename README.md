# Speed typing game

You know, I'm something of a speed-typer myself 👨🏻‍💻. 
This app was made using React.js with `custom hook` for easier maintainability and readability of code.

## `yarn install`

for installing all necessary dependencies

## `yarn start`

for running app in development mode

### You can also run the app from browser - link 👉🏻👆🏻
